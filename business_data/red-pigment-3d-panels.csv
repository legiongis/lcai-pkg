It features four zoomrophs that represent two pecking episodes based on variation in repatination. The largest zoomorph, 1.3 m in length, is both a bighorn sheep and a deer in depiction. Although the sheep's horns are most apparent, two lightly pecked antler horns extend upward from the sheep's upper horn, and the second antler with three terminal branches originates at the back of the neck below the lower sheep horn. The deer's antlers are a later addition to the sheep but appear to be the same relative age. A curved tail and the rear legs may have been repecked at a later date. With long, sweeping, upturned tails, the next three zoomorphs are much smaller than the deer/sheep element and have short ""ears"" rather than the long, curved sheep horns. These smaller animals are thought to represent canines, or possibly predatory animals such as pumas. One of the long-tailed animals is more recently pecked than the other elements on this panel.",Red-Pigment_Feature32_Panel1.ply,PLY,Centimeter,Red-Pigment_Feature32_Panel1_preview.jpg,,,Point (-115.2813695 37.36041614)

Note weighed atlatl.<br><br>Measuring 57 cm tall and high above the canyon floor in an area that is difficult and dangerous to access, a single, well-defined Pahranagat patterned body antropomorph is depicted. A weighted atlatl extends horizontally from its right side, and fringe hangs between the two stick legs. The figure's internal design is composed of two vertical lines, one each to the inside of the defining body shape lines. In addition, there are three dotted lines, the left dotted line having eight dots and the other two having seven dots each. A horizontal line connects the three dotted lines at the third dot down from the top.
