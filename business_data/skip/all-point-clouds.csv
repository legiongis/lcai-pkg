a0a0a0a0-0001-0000-0000-000000000000,Paiute Rocks - Full Site,"26LN356 was originally recorded in the late 1960s by the Desert Research Institute (Fowler and Sharrock 1973) and was again recorded in the 1970s by the University of California, Berkeley (Heizer and Hester 1974). The many rock art panels at this site were recorded by the Nevada Rock Art Foundation (NRAF) in 2005 (Woody et al. 2005) and updated in 2010 (Quinlan et al. 2010).<br><br>The roughly 100-x-90-m site is situated in an area with large, tuff monoliths, with surrounding sediments composed of decomposing tuffaceous gravels. Vegetation in the area includes sagebrush, blackbrush, bunchgrass, ephedra, and scattered pinyon-juniper trees. ASM's current visit found the rock art well-documented and also identified and recorded a sparse habitation deposit. In its current state, 26LN356 is classified as a rock art and complex habitation site. Eighty-two rock art panels are present (all previously identified), with habitation remains including a bedrock milling station (Feature 1), a CCS biface (Artifact 1), and 25 pieces of CCS and obsidian debitage. Two projectile point fragments found by NRAF in 2005 were not relocated during their subsequent update or during the current visit. Unfortunately, this site has been subjected to visitation, vandalism, and looting for decades; today it displays these effects in the form of roads, graffiti, campfire remnants, and discarded refuse. The site has also been affected by erosion, wildlife trampling, and by the spalling/weathering of the rock faces. It remains in fair condition.",Paiute-Rocks.zip,PTS,Centimeter,"MULTIPOLYGON (((-115.373249665442 37.6060060358474,-115.373293358987 37.6060058226333,-115.373325088037 37.6060068864597,-115.373350949306 37.6060136572513,-115.373377322138 37.6060237787529,-115.373404098869 37.6060387095157,-115.373428260533 37.6060556392588,-115.373486648283 37.6061008247765,-115.373520195445 37.6061219197139,-115.373639818974 37.6061777612818,-115.373664520548 37.6061910535646,-115.37370862886 37.6062147888761,-115.373787334363 37.6062611708787,-115.373841001282 37.6062931210888,-115.373869154293 37.6063131123468,-115.373900119354 37.6063393835581,-115.373916451453 37.6063592596531,-115.373926100259 37.6063794789442,-115.373938050181 37.606412586377,-115.373945545547 37.6064457045174,-115.373945827358 37.6064489039456,-115.373948383084 37.6064779193939,-115.373946512822 37.6065086120561,-115.373942192529 37.6065342960146,-115.37393621147 37.6065510842108,-115.373923225728 37.6065688231288,-115.373893836664 37.6065964868269,-115.373854695299 37.6066312604079,-115.373811734552 37.606663665103,-115.373765967941 37.6066929379945,-115.373718420242 37.6067184235707,-115.373650538277 37.6067490426839,-115.373590924405 37.6067704260945,-115.373535364623 37.6067840748984,-115.37348319873 37.6067900827434,-115.373446632798 37.6067903906806,-115.373395891378 37.6067894586202,-115.373363523428 37.6067872341953,-115.373334865321 37.6067827320618,-115.373310198142 37.6067757379939,-115.373289280215 37.6067671535237,-115.373264477693 37.6067545679861,-115.373211870577 37.6067219111223,-115.373187390945 37.6067088054893,-115.37315692637 37.6066969538916,-115.373083251397 37.6066743006286,-115.373051535984 37.6066603786931,-115.373031127247 37.6066476644307,-115.373011526813 37.6066325837958,-115.372992590848 37.6066150311611,-115.372974072825 37.6065947787141,-115.372939098642 37.6065479799296,-115.372890350071 37.6064703069904,-115.37287663251 37.6064496133227,-115.372871192903 37.6064379535519,-115.372868601032 37.6064223008313,-115.372869337751 37.6063994073544,-115.37287404733 37.606371627076,-115.372885527608 37.6063367886987,-115.372907202991 37.6062909477786,-115.372916711328 37.6062423146052,-115.372922520489 37.6062258341236,-115.372928509576 37.606215081807,-115.372940788611 37.6061988500687,-115.372965665577 37.6061730152229,-115.373009947965 37.6061288280033,-115.373049530725 37.6060955866156,-115.373053484438 37.6060928749377,-115.373093895019 37.6060651590785,-115.373149145765 37.6060313541136,-115.373169338093 37.6060219106768,-115.373188602849 37.6060153691114,-115.373206222097 37.6060116432258,-115.373219074871 37.6060089252889,-115.373249665442 37.6060060358474)))","a0a0a0a0-0000-0100-0000-000000000000,a0a0a0a0-0000-1200-0000-000000000000,a0a0a0a0-0000-1300-0000-000000000000,a0a0a0a0-0000-18a0-0000-000000000000,a0a0a0a0-0000-18b0-0000-000000000000,a0a0a0a0-0000-1900-0000-000000000000,a0a0a0a0-0000-2200-0000-000000000000,a0a0a0a0-0000-2300-0000-000000000000,a0a0a0a0-0000-2700-0000-000000000000,a0a0a0a0-0000-3100-0000-000000000000,a0a0a0a0-0000-4349-0000-000000000000,a0a0a0a0-0000-5051-0000-000000000000,a0a0a0a0-0000-5859-0000-000000000000,a0a0a0a0-0000-0700-0000-000000000000",https://lcai-assets.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pointclouds/paiute-rocks-site/Paiute-Rocks/cloud.js
b0b0b0b0-0001-0000-0000-000000000000,Red Pigment - Full Site,"26LN4232 is an extensive, linear rock art and complex habitation site covering a 373-x-65-m area within a narrow southwest to northeast-trending canyon. The lower, northeastern portion of the site was recorded by White (1997 and 1999) and Lee (2002), who identified a rockshelter, several bedrock milling stations, and over 20 rock art panels. ASM Affiliates, Inc. revisited the site in 2014 and found the complex to be more extensive than previously recorded, reaching a couple of hundred meters up the canyon to another cluster of rock art panels. As currently mapped, the site contains three major zones of rock art panels within a deep, narrow and rocky canyon. The upper two zones have very little sediment, that present consisting of recent, tuff-derived alluvium. The lowest zone of rock art (visited byWhite and Lee) spreads from the canyon out beyond its mouth, incorporating a small alluvial flat. Vegetation throughout the area is limited to pinyon-juniper woodland associates and willows. Ground visibility is restricted by the presence of bedrock outcrops and vegetation, estimated at 75 percent where stabilized soils occur.<br><br>The current boundaries of 26LN4232 include at least 60 rock art features (Features 1-23, 25-32, 34-42, 45-48, and 50-65) and five bedrock milling stations (Features 24, 33, 43, 44, and 49). At least two of the rock art panels exhibit both petroglyphs and pictographs (Features 19 and 47), and one panel exhibits only pictographs (Feature 42). Features 1 through 23, 51, and 58-65 represent newly recorded rock art features, located in the southwestern portion of the site. Rock art features numbered from 25-50 and 52-57 are panels previously documented byWhite (1999) and Lee (2002). All were mapped but only a sample of them photographed. The rockshelter identified byWhite and Lee is designated Feature 43, a boulder overhang located at the lowest, northeast end of the site. It measures 4 m wide, 2.6 m deep, and has a ~2-m tall entrance; a single milling slick occurs on a boulder just beyond the shelter apron. A midden deposit occurs inside the shelter and extends ~5 m beyond the entrance to the east, and an associated artifact scatter extends another 10 m northeast of the midden. Flakes of CCS, bits of charcoal, and faunal bone were observed in the shelter. Artifacts associated with Feature 43 are the only artifacts observed anywhere within the site area; those outside the shelter include two CCS middle-stage bifaces (Artifacts 2 and 3), one Great Basin Brown Ware rim sherd (Artifact 1), and an estimated 80 pieces of debitage. The shelter was tested byWhite in 1999; see Feature 43 description below for details.<br><br>All in all, this site remains in good condition. None of its rock art panels are excessively exfoliated, and only one appears to have been intentionally defaced (by shooting). The midden at Feature 43 appears intact other than the small test excavation conducted byWhite (1999) and looks to still contain dateable organic remains and timesensitive artifacts.",Red-Pigment.zip,PTS,Centimeter,"MULTIPOLYGON (((-115.281378496436 37.3598578705828,-115.281903707604 37.35963829617,-115.282221706145 37.3594666354573,-115.282686344403 37.3593206071201,-115.28329048831 37.3592980399034,-115.283890171345 37.3592558191275,-115.284218690116 37.359268421054,-115.284284876233 37.3593790672173,-115.284228592904 37.3596955563475,-115.28383852514 37.3597995818735,-115.283588053565 37.3598076983675,-115.283116099224 37.3598439381774,-115.282797479568 37.3598275599486,-115.282475025841 37.3597641161937,-115.282178793532 37.3598420776154,-115.281787292422 37.3600087541412,-115.28167106128 37.3601559242734,-115.281566958245 37.3604168741915,-115.281446739654 37.360569559854,-115.281276478923 37.3606815135543,-115.281120148615 37.360777473736,-115.280928218336 37.3608242235236,-115.280751766305 37.3608365260945,-115.280561383851 37.3608291445522,-115.280371001397 37.3607946973453,-115.280299027542 37.3607497929269,-115.280264975396 37.3606962766672,-115.280260331921 37.3606076979465,-115.280278905819 37.3605412638373,-115.280299801454 37.3605080467607,-115.280323196572 37.3604702466842,-115.2803713253 37.3603368153966,-115.28044134968 37.3602790738302,-115.280580951307 37.3601831697838,-115.280802346436 37.3601589673009,-115.281094836111 37.3600300290255,-115.281378496436 37.3598578705828)))",,https://lcai-assets.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pointclouds/red-pigment-site/Red-Pigment/cloud.js
c0c0c0c0-0001-0000-0000-000000000000,Crescent City - Full Site,"26LN7526 is an expansive multicomponent site consisting of a prehistoric basic habitation deposit and the historic townsite of Crescent Spring/Crescent City. The site encompasses the floor and lower slopes of a broad drainage basin on the west side of the Pahranagat Range; tuff and limestone outcrops are abundant and slopes are dissected by many drainages, creating a deposit of mixed alluvium across the basin floor. The site lies within a dense pinyonjuniper woodland vegetation community that has a minimal understory, allowing for reasonable ground visibility (~75 percent).<br><br>The prehistoric component contains one stacked rock cache (Feature 7) and an extremely widespread artifact deposit that varies greatly in density. Ten discrete accumulations of artifacts were identified along the southern and eastern edges of the site (Concentrations 1-10); see end of form for details. Beyond the concentrations, the remainder of the prehistoric site inventory consists of one CCS Elko Corner-notched point (Artifact 116), two Elko series points (Artifacts 84 and 129), an obsidian untypable dart point (Artifact 19), two CCS Rose Spring projectile points (Artifact 83 and 114), two CCS untypable points (Artifacts 82 and 94), a total of 34 bifaces (Artifacts 2, 11-13, 15- 17, 20, 23, 24, 26-29, 35, 41, 44-46, 48, 49, 61, 79-81, 95, 99, 100-102, 106, 107, 115, and 117), two cores (Artifacts 6 and 22), three simple flake tools (Artifact 14, 96, and 124), nine millingstones (Artifacts 25, 36, 47, 97, 98 103-105, and 108), a granitic handstone (Artifact 93), and more than 10,000 pieces of quartzite, CCS, and obsidian debitage.<br><br>The historic component represents the substantial mining camp that settled at Crescent Spring in the 1860s. The most prominent features at the site are a large mill pad (Feature 21) with a flue leading up to a 60 ft tall brick chimney (Feature 20). These elements may have been constructed by the Alameda Silver Mining Company during their initial investment in the nearby List Mine in 1866 and 1867. Brick concentrations near the mill and chimney may be construction-related byproducts (Features 13, 19, 22). A large ore dump (Feature 23) near the mill and chimney as well as a possible assay or cuppeling furnace (Feature 25) are some indications that ore processing took place on site. Elsewhere, a wide range of living and working areas is represented by platforms (Features 12 and 26), dugouts (Features 32 and 34), rock or cut stone house foundations (Feature 15, 18, 27, 35, 36, 38, 40, and 41), a possible cellar or well wall (Feature 17), and a stone cabin (Feature 46). The site also has several rock alignments of unknown function that are likely of historic age (Features 1-5, and 8-10), two pits (Features 14 and 47), a berm (Feature 37), various rock cairns (Feature 11, 42, and 48), and a historic stacked rock cache (Feature 16). Several roads are also evident, including the road that loops around the townsite (Feature 45), one leading up to the stone cabin (Feature 44), and a short ditch leading up to a subterranean cellar (Feature 43). A retaining wall (Feature 39) supports the side of one of the roads. There is only one discrete refuse deposit (Feature 33) but a wide variety of historic artifacts is spread across the townsite. Altogether, these items span both domestic and work spheres. Diagnostic food and drink containers include a kick-up bottle base (Artifact 126), Atrasks Ointment bottle (Artifact 127), aqua glass flakes (Artifact 125), Drake's Plantation bitters bottle fragment (Artifact 132), a Lea & Perrins bottle (Artifact 135), applied bottle finishes (Artifacts 131 and 134), and a stoneware Hartley jam jar (Artifact 133). Work-related artifacts include a tractor clutch link (Artifact 136) and a crucible fragment (Artifact 128). A metal button (Artifact 21) was the only clothing-item noted on site. Diagnostic artifacts associated with the mining and townsite features show a general production range that is consistent with occupation of Crescent Spring from the 1860s through the 1910s.<br><br>In addition, the western part of the site contains features and artifacts related to use of Crescent Spring for ranching and recreation purposes throughout the twentieth century. A large water tank and associated trough (Feature 30), two circular rock concentrations (Features 28 and 29), and a campfire ring (Feature 31) are all associated with twentieth century artifacts including sanitary cans and hole-in-top milk cans that indicate use of this area between the 1930s and 1970s.<br><br>Both archaeological components at this site remain in good physical condition despite impacts from cattle trampling, camping, vehicle traffic, artifact collecting, and vandalism. Two BLM ARPA signs are posted at the west end of the site but are deteriorated. Artifacts 17 (Obsidian Sample 12), 19 (Obsidian Sample 13), and 124 (Obsidian Sample 20) as well as thirty-one obsidian flakes were collected for laboratory analysis and will be curated at the Nevada State Museum in Carson City, Nevada. Thirteen obsidian flakes were collected from the general site area (Obsidian Samples 1-11 and 14-15) and 18 were collected from Concentration 5 (Obsidian Samples 16 -19 and 21-34).
