c0c0c0c0-0002-0000-0000-000000000000,Crescent City - Cabin,"The Crescent City Stone Cabin (SHPO Resource # B17589) is a one-story, two-room stone cabin located on a gently south-trending slope in an area vegetated with pinyon, juniper, small sagebrush, ephedra, and creosote. It lies within multicomponent site 26LN7526, the historic component of which is the Crescent City mining camp (part of the Pahranagat Mining District), and was originally recorded by ASM Affiliates in 2013 as Feature 46 of that site. The cabin is roughly rectangular in plan, except for a projecting room at the southeast corner that gives it an irregular shape. The cabin measures approximately 31ft x 21ft, with its long axis oriented north/south, and sits on a level dirt pad dug partially into the slope. The primary elevation faces south.<br>The building is constructed of undressed native stone slabs with chinking of mud and small rocks, and has straight, well-built walls that are approximately 2 feet thick. Portions of some of the walls have collapsed so their total original height and configuration are unknown; the north wall retains an angled gable shape to support the roof structure, and the south wall is presumed to have once been the same. The building's front-gabled roof, which is mostly collapsed with intact remnants restricted to the north portion, is constructed of delimbed pinyon or juniper trunk rafters topped with sediment, supported by two large pinyon vertical posts on the cabin's interior. Large pinyon logs serve as plates atop the stone walls, and the rafters rest on interior crossbeams and uprights; most have no nails or fasteners at all, while others have large wire nails and lengths of baling wire (suggesting later repair/reinforcement). All of the roof members appear to be axe-cut.<br>The small exterior room at the cabin's southeast corner is roughly rectangular and has walls constructed of two rows of native stone with earthen fill in between. Its south elevation is largely collapsed, and no evidence of a roof structure is present aside from several small fragments of galvanized sheet metal.<br>The building's south (primary) elevation is partially collapsed at its eastern part, but the main doorway is intact, comprising an opening in the stone wall without wood framing. It is 3ft 4in wide and its original height is unknown. Short lengths of milled lumber are present in either side of the stone frame, set horizontally within the walls themselves; the one on the west side has a small square nail in it and may have been used to affix the door. Twisted lengths of baling wire are also present. The wire, along with the presence of a board and baling wire gate (lying in the building's interior) suggest the doorway may have been closed off at a later date for use as a corral/stable, or to keep animals out of the building.<br>The east elevation has no doors or windows. Its southern portion is the ancillary exterior room described above.<br>The north (rear) elevation has no doors or windows. The walls are intact, and slope up to form a gable shape to support the roof. A large exterior stone chimney is present at this elevation, projecting from the wall; it is constructed of the same stone as the rest of the building, though most of its mud chinking is deteriorated/missing. The top of the chimney is collapsed and its original height is unknown.<br>The building's west elevation has a 3ft 4in wide x 4ft 4in tall opening, either a window or a short door, topped by a pinyon log lintel/roof plate. No other wood framing is present.<br>The cabin's interior is a single open room with a dirt floor (it is unknown whether a floor lies beneath the loose accumulated sediment). Most of the roof has collapsed into the interior, and is restricted to the northern portion of the room; it is presumed to have once covered the entire house and portions have been removed. A wire and wood gate, collapsed roof members, milled lumber, and a piece of plywood with screws in it lie in the room's northern part. A semicircle of stones in the room's southwest corner indicate the modern placement of a campfire ring.<br>The interior north wall contains a well-constructed integral stone fireplace with a pinyon or juniper limb mantel/lintel. The interior of the fireplace has black discoloration from smoke.",Crescent-City-Cabin.zip,PTS,Centimeter,Point (-115.42598469 37.60631951),
c0c0c0c0-0003-0000-0000-000000000000,Crescent City - Mill Chimney,"The Crescent City Mill Chimney (SHPO Resource #S2121) is the sole extant architectural remnant of the Crescent/List Mill, established here in 1867 to process the silver ores from the List Mine in the Pahranagat Mining District. It is a tall brick and stone smokestack/chimney located on a north-trending slope in an area vegetated with pinyon, juniper, small sagebrush, ephedra, and creosote. The structure lies within multicomponent site 26LN7526, the historic component of which is the Crescent City mining camp, and was originally recorded by ASM Affiliates in 2013 as Feature 20 of that site. The chimney structure is connected via a buried stone-lined flue to a mill pad (Feature 21) downslope to the north where the mill building once stood. This flue is open near the chimney but is otherwise capped by an arched brick cover running underground.<br>The chimney structure has a rectangular footprint and tapering rectangular shape. Its base (roasting furnace) is constructed of rough-cut native stone slabs held together with mud chinking or a very friable/deteriorated cementitious mortar. It is 9 feet square at the base, which is dug partly into the slope to the north to provide a level surface. The stone tapers to an area 7 feet square above the base, to a height of about 8 feet. Above that, the chimney is constructed of red brick with cement mortar, laid in a common bond pattern. The brick portion of the chimney continues to taper as it rises, reaching a height of approximately 55 feet. The top of the chimney has a square piece of flat iron sheet metal laid horizontally, above which sits a decorative brick cap with whitewashed bricks set at oblique angles to create an ornamental pattern. Two wythes of brick sit above the decorative row, and portions of them are deteriorated and loose. The brick portion of the chimney exhibits multiple small round holes, and a few small rectangular openings appear to have been bricked in later. The structure's brick is wind-blasted and rough-surfaced.<br>The north elevation of the base contains an arched opening of yellow firebricks, some of which have remnants of a glassy blue-green 'glazing' which appears to be the result of overfiring or ore roasting rather than a purposefully applied glaze. One of the firebricks has '1880' scratched into it. Through the arch, the interior of the furnace is visible, displaying the same rough-cut native stone seen on the exterior. Some of the stones exhibit black discoloration from fires.",Crescent-City-Stack.zip,PTS,Centimeter,Point (-115.42867197 37.60637044),
